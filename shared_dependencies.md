Shared Dependencies:

1. **Auction Types**: The auction types (sealed, double-blind, vickery) are shared across the auction files and their corresponding test files. They define the rules and procedures for the auctions.

2. **Agent**: The agent is a shared entity across the agent-protocol files and their corresponding test files. It represents the bidding entity in the auctions.

3. **Queue**: The queue is a shared concept across the agent-protocol files and their corresponding test files. It represents the list of tasks that agents can bid on.

4. **Message**: The message is a shared concept across the agent-protocol files and their corresponding test files. It represents the communication medium between agents.

5. **InterCode**: InterCode is a shared framework across the InterCode files and their corresponding test files. It provides the environment for interactive coding.

6. **Bash Environment and SQL Environment**: These are shared across the InterCode files and their corresponding test files. They represent the action spaces for interactive coding.

7. **Seq2Seq, ReAct, PlanAndSolve**: These are shared methods across the InterCode files and their corresponding test files. They represent different prompting strategies for interactive code generation.

8. **CaptureTheFlag**: This is a shared task across the InterCode files and their corresponding test files. It represents a multi-step coding puzzle.

Please note that the shared dependencies are inferred based on the file names and the provided context. The actual shared dependencies may vary based on the implementation details of these files.
