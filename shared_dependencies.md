Shared Dependencies:

1. **Agent**: This is a class or object that is shared across all files. It represents the agents that interact with the system.

2. **Task**: This is a class or object that represents the tasks that agents can bid on and carry out.

3. **Bid**: This is a class or object that represents the bids made by agents on tasks.

4. **Message**: This is a class or object that represents the messages passed between agents and the system.

5. **Queue**: This is a data structure that holds the tasks that agents can bid on.

6. **Auction**: This is a class or object that represents the different types of auctions (sealed, double-blind, vickery) that the system can hold.

7. **InterCode**: This is a framework that is used across multiple files for interactive coding.

8. **Execution Feedback**: This is a class or object that represents the feedback from the execution of code.

9. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: This is a method used across multiple files for learning from the execution feedback.

10. **Docker Environment**: This is a class or object that represents the Docker environments used for safe and reproducible execution.

11. **Bash Environment and SQL Environment**: These are classes or objects that represent the different coding environments available.

12. **ReAct Strategy and Plan & Solve Strategy**: These are classes or objects that represent the different prompting strategies used in the InterCode framework.

13. **Capture the Flag**: This is a class or object that represents a coding puzzle task.

Please note that these are high-level shared dependencies. The actual shared dependencies including function names, variable names, etc. would be determined during the actual coding process.
